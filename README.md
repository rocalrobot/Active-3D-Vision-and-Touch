# RoCAL forked Active 3D vision and touch

#### Worked on by: Yicheng Zhu

This workspace is for Yicheng to keep track of the progress of replicating the forked repo. Yicheng is more familiar with markdown formatting than latex, that's why the note is written here. 
After the work has been implemented, this documentation will be trimmed down, cleaned up and added to the formal documentation.
